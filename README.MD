The objective of this project is to implement a convolutional neural network to determine whether
a person is wearing glasses or not. This is a binary classification problem using the CelebA dataset.
We have chosen to implement the convolutional neural network using Tensorflow. In the project
below, we have taken a subset of the training data and the whole training dataset, tested models
with varying layers (7,9, and 11 layers), used dropout for regularization, and changed the
resolution of the images for a one channel model. For a three channel model, we used an optimal
architecture for classification based on the CIFAR-10 model implementation for object
classification.
